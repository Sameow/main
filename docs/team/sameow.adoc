== PROJECT: Efficient Learning Scheduler

---

== Overview

This is a desktop Efficient Learning Scheduler application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is a Java application targeting NUS School of Computing students who are interested to learn how to learn.

We believe that with our application at your expense, you will be able to develop a good and efficient learning habit that will help you achieve your academic or career goals.
